# WorldFish_Assignment

A Simple Data Analysis of Life Expectancy by World Bank was performed as an assignment which is a part of the interview process for WorldFish Organization.

## Datasets:

The dataset (life_expectancy.csv) directory consist of Original dataset which was shared by WorldFish. Also, With in the same directory there is another dataset (df_eda.csv) which was obtained after performing basic data cleaning.

## Data Cleaning & EDA

After reading the original dataset. Some insights were gathered from the dataset. All the commands and insights can be found in the jupyter notebook (Life_Expectancy.ipynb) and at [insights](https://mutiullahkhan.github.io/WorldFish-Assignment/df_profile.html). The same notebook was also used to perform data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Data Visualization

Basic data visualization was performed in the above mentioned notebook. Later, a dashboard was configured using the tableau public (WorldFish_Dashboard_mmkhan.png) software. The interactive dashboard can be accessed using the [Dashboard.me](Dashborad.md) file attached in the main branch of the above repository.

## Conclusion

The life expectancy data by world bank provides details of 174 countries. There are several factors that can effect the life expectancy and some of that were mentioned in the dataset. Such as:
- Sanitation
- CO2 Emission & Education Expenditure.

Also, CO2 emission is a leading cause of different injuries and diseases. These patterns were visualized using plots and dashboard. 
Although the data is very small to derive any hard conclusions. 
But Time series analysis could be performed to identify the seasonalities and effect of weather with the CO2 emission. Also, the Machine Learning model can be developed to predict the life expectancy of a country were for upcoming years.

Finally, Even though the dataset is small but has so many key details of a country and region that many more conclusions can be derived from it.
